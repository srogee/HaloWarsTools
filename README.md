# HaloWarsTools

WIP utility to read Halo Wars Definitive Edition files and convert them to common formats for importing into game engines, 3d modeling software, etc. Based off the binary templates in the HaloWarsDocs repository. Currently pretty limited as I migrate stuff over from my old HaloWarsFormats repository.
